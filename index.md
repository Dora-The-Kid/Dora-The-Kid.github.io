## Research Interests

- Mathmatical Princple of Machine Learning
- Computational Neuroscience
- The Intersection of AI and Neuroscience
- AI for Science

My current research focuses on the computational neuroscience and AI,  exploring the the mechanisms giving rise to intelligence as well as developing tools to better understand neural networks. My interests are on the **the uderlying princple of animal intelligence and artificial intelligence** and applying these theories to **develop more powerful artificial  algorithms**.  There is a prevailing belief that similar mathematical mechanisms underlie both artificial and animal intelligence, primarily because early efforts in AI aimed to create an "artificial brain" to understand how brains compute, thus exploring the fundamental mechanisms of intelligence is crucial for advancing AI models and understanding animal intelligence. I wish to devote my talent to this attractive cause and bring well-being to society.
